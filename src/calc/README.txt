Other Instructions: 
> This application is defined in a package calc, so must be included in package or the package must be removed from the source files. 
> This application is built on windows but there seems to be some layout issues when executed on a MAC eclipse IDE (from what I have tested), so please use a windows environment for optimal layout.
